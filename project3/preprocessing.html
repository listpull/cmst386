    <h2>ways to implement preprocessing (client-side vs server-side) </h2>
	<p>Client-side preprocessing involves using preprocessors like LESS or SASS in the browser itself. The preprocessor code is compiled to CSS on the client-side, and the resulting CSS is then served to the user's browser.</p>

	<p>Server-side preprocessing, on the other hand, involves using preprocessors in the server environment. The preprocessor code is compiled to CSS on the server-side before the page is served to the user's browser.</p>	


    <!-- Multi-column layout -->
	<h3>Mechanisms used in either LESS or SASS: mixins, variables, functions, operators, nested variables</h3>
    <div class="grid">
        <div class="column"><p><strong>Mixins:</strong> Mixins allow you to define reusable blocks of code that can be included in multiple styles. They help in reducing code duplication and promote modular and maintainable stylesheets.</p></div>
        <div class="column"><p><strong>Variables:</strong>Variables allow you to define and store values that can be reused throughout the stylesheet. They enable consistent and centralized control over colors, font sizes, spacing, and other properties.</p></div>
        <div class="column"><p><strong>Functions:</strong></p>Functions provide the ability to define and use custom operations or calculations in your stylesheets. They allow for dynamic values and calculations, enhancing the flexibility of styling.</div>
	<div class="column"><p><strong>Operators:</strong></p> Operators in preprocessors allow you to perform mathematical operations within stylesheets. They enable computations such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing values, providing more control over the styles.</div>
	<div class="column"><p><strong>Nested Variables: </strong> Preprocessors like LESS and SASS support nested variables, allowing you to define and use variables within nested blocks of code. This simplifies the management of styles by keeping related styles organized and accessible within their respective blocks.</p></div>
